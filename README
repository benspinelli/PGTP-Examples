This repository contains example output from the PGTP plugin.

To view a 3D model, simply click on the name of the file. Click and drag
vertically and horizontally to rotate the camera, and use the mouse wheel to
zoom in and out. If you are inactive for a few seconds, the camera will
automatically begin to rotate around the model from its current vantage point.

The models are numbered from least to most complex, with the first model
taking less than a second to generate and the last model taking about four
seconds to generate.
